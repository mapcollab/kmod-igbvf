.SH NAME
igbvf \-This file describes the Linux* Base Driver for the Gigabit Family of Adapters.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PD 0.4v
modprobe igbvf [<option>=<VAL1>,<VAL2>,...]
.PD 1v
.SH DESCRIPTION
This driver is intended for \fB2.6.30\fR and later kernels. 
This driver includes support for Intel(R) Itanium(R)2-based systems.
.LP
This driver is only supported as a loadable module at this time. Intel is
not supplying patches against the kernel source to allow for static linking of
the drivers.
 
 
For questions related to hardware requirements, refer to the documentation
supplied with your Intel adapter. All hardware requirements listed apply to
use with Linux.
.SH OPTIONS
The following optional parameters are used by entering them on the
command line with the modprobe command.
For example:
.IP
modprobe igbvf InterruptThrottleRate=16000,16000
.LP
.B InterruptThrottleRate
.IP  
.B Valid Range: 
0=off
1=dynamic
3=dynamic conservative
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR>
.IP  
Interrupt Throttle Rate controls the number of interrupts each interrupt
vector can generate per second. Increasing ITR lowers latency at the cost of
increased CPU utilization, though it may help throughput in some circumstances.
.IP  
0 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to 0 turns off any interrupt moderation 
  and may improve small packet latency. However, this is generally not 
  suitable for bulk throughput traffic due to the increased CPU utilization
  of the higher interrupt rate.
  NOTES:
  - On 82599, X540, and X550-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate
    will also result in the driver disabling HW RSC.
  - On 82598-based adapters, disabling InterruptThrottleRate will also 
    result in disabling LRO (Large Receive Offloads).
.IP  
1 = Setting InterruptThrottleRate to Dynamic mode attempts to moderate
  interrupts per vector while maintaining very low latency. This can 
  sometimes cause extra CPU utilization. If planning on deploying igbvf
  in a latency sensitive environment, this parameter should be considered.
.IP  
<min_ITR>-<max_ITR> = 100-100000
  Setting InterruptThrottleRate to a value greater or equal to <min_ITR> 
  will program the adapter to send at most that many interrupts 
  per second, even if more packets have come in. This reduces interrupt load 
  on the system and can lower CPU utilization under heavy load, but will 
  increase latency as packets are not processed as quickly.
 
 .IP  
.SH Jumbo Frames
.LP
Jumbo Frames support is enabled by changing the Maximum Transmission Unit
(MTU) to a value larger than the default value of 1500.
 
Use the ifconfig command to increase the MTU size. For example, enter the
following where <x> is the interface number:
 
   ifconfig eth<x> mtu 9000 up
 
.LP  
NOTES:
- The maximum MTU setting for Jumbo Frames is 9216. This value coincides
  with the maximum Jumbo Frames size of 9234 bytes.
- Using Jumbo frames at 10 or 100 Mbps is not supported and may result in
  poor performance or loss of link.
See the section "Jumbo Frames" in the Readme.
.SH ethtool
.LP  
The driver utilizes the ethtool interface for driver configuration and
diagnostics, as well as displaying statistical information. The latest
ethtool version is required for this functionality. Download it at
http://ftp.kernel.org/pub/software/network/ethtool/
